1. What are alternatives to default parameters?
-If a parameter is not provided, then its value b1 ecomes undefined.Inorder to execute a meaningful message we can create its own function and to make it more formal.

2. What are things you should consider while naming a function?
- use a verb
-it should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe.

3. Do functions need to be always commented? Write your understanding based on
the reading.
- No, but function is not easier to test or debug. Because of that if we add comments it help us to understand more. 


4. When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?
-  Function declatation - when we need to declare a function as a separate statment in the main code flow.
- Function expression  - when we need a conditional declatation, to create as a part of an expression. 
5. Function are values in JavaScript. They can be assigned, copied, or declared in any
place of the code. Is this a true or a false statement? Support your answer with
examples.
-yes,

func(); // Hello     // to run the copy
sayHi(); // Hello
